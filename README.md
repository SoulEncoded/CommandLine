# Command Line

## What is Command line
When I first started to learn how to program, I remember that the Command Line Interface (CLI) was very intimidating. It was like black magic watching my developer friends hammer away commands into a black terminal. Just like everything in programming, the bare essentials of CLI is small. So what is CLI?

In the simplest form a CLI is a way for users to type in commands to interact with a computer.

However, there are some major confuse in the industry when it comes to terminology. Here are a few that get tossed around a lot to describe CLI.

- terminal: a place to input text
- console: is a physical hardware device
- shell: command line interpreter
- bash: a unix based shell

From my experience, some developers will just use these terminology to describe a CLI. Don't let this confuse you.

For our purposes we will be using the Mac OS X command line using the Bash shell, which is unix based shell. We will also use Apples default Terminal

For Windows users I'll cover this later but for now look in the additional resources to get started.

## Popular Shells and CLIs (Optional)

Once you get familiar with the basics, look into these other Shell and CLI options.

### Shells

I still just use bash but a lot of people use zsh

## The Problem
## Basics commands for Mac OS X

Mac OS X is based on a Unix based operating system.

  - `cd`: change directory
  - `cd ~`: change directory to root
  - `cd ..`: go up one directory
  - `pwd`: print current directory path
  - `ls` : lists files in current directory
  - `mkdir`: create a new folder
  - `rmdir`: removes a folder
  - `touch`: create a new file
  - `mv`: move a file to a new location
  - `rm`: remove file
  - `cp`: copies a file
  - `man`: opens the manual of a command
  - `vim`: opens a vim editor
